This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## GitHub Pages

This repo is configured to deploy a static export to GitHub Pages via `pages.yml`.

Requirements:
- Set a GitHub Actions Variable: `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` (e.g. `https://tharaday-vercel.vercel.app`).

Notes:
- The workflow auto-detects whether the repo is `*.github.io` (root site) or a project page and sets `basePath`/`assetPrefix` accordingly.
- The output is generated with `next build` using `output: "export"` and deployed from the `out/` folder.

## Configuration

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`: Public API base URL (set as a GitHub Actions Variable).

## Deploy Checklist

1) Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` in GitHub Actions Variables.
2) Push to `main`.
3) Verify the Pages build in the Actions tab and visit the published URL.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
